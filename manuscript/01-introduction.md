# Why?[^startwithwhy]

There are *so many* reasons to test your software "*product*" we could write a book just on *why testing is essential*; here are the top 7 reasons:

## 1. Tranquillity

This is the *first* (*reason to test*) because its the *answer* to the question:
"***what's in it for me?***" - people who are *sceptical about testing
inevitably ask*.  
The ***Peace of Mind*** you get from knowing your project/product works
*consistently* means you can have a life instead of constantly worrying
about if something *else* has broken since the last "*patch*".

*Some* people have a coding "*day job*" ~~they attend between 9-to-5,
to collect a paycheck~~ to fund their other (*more important?*) activities;
e.g. raising a family, traveling or playing/watching sport/music/video games.

If you have trouble leaving your work at work (*because things are*
  "***breaking***") or switching off, or just want some 
"***work-life-balance***" (*automated*) ***testing*** is your ***best friend***!



## 2. Useability

When a site/app does not function as expected (*or worse, "breaks"*) when people
attempt to use it, it frustrates them. If you have a way of *automatically testing*
(*checking*) Less Frustration for the People Using your Product!

## 3. Trust

How do you know the code you wrote a month ago is still working as expected?
How can we be sure that a dependency we have included

## 4. Cost (*Saving*)


## 5. Conversion


## 6. Innovation



## 7.


# Types of Testing

## *Manual* Testing

*Many* people writing software *today* *still* "*test*" their work by *manually*
clicking-through their app *each time* they make a *change*.

This works while an app is *small* and has few components, but ***does not
scale*** as functionality grows.

Sadly, there are still *plenty* of people working as software developers
who cling to the "**its not *my* job**" attitude towards writing tests.
We want to dispel the *myth* that
We want to change that by showing everyone how *productive

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q**: Is there still a place for *manual* testing?  
**Yes** (Absolutely)! Manual testing should done by:
+ Your **Quality Assurance** (**QA**) people, who sign off on a feature
before it gets published.
+ The **Product Owner(s)** (person/people responsible for
  prioritising which feature should be built first)
+ **Existing** *or* ***potential*** **users** of your product/service
can (should) be invited to test any new **User Interface** (UI),
**User Experience** (UX) or **Accessibility**; *nothing is more insightful
than watching people use your app/site*.
+ **Compliance Team** check over a product before it can be released (if you operate in a *regulated industry*)
+ **Penetration Testing** in many cases is still performed *manually* (albeit using
  scripts and semi-automated tools) the expert tester still needs to *observe* the
  output to confirm the system under test is not vulnerable to *know atacks*.
