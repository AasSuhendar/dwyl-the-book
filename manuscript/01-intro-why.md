# Why?[^startwithwhy]

There are *so many* reasons to test your software "*product*" we could write a book just on *why testing is essential*; here are the top 7 reasons:

## 1. Tranquillity

This is the *first* (*reason to test*) because its the *answer* to the question:
"***what's in it for me?***" - people who are *sceptical about testing
inevitably ask*.  

Working in a place without tests is stressful because you never know what is going  to "*break*" next. It can feel like your application is stuck together with *duck tape* and changing one thing will break another. If this sounds like a project you have worked on, get ready for a better life!

The ***peace of mind*** you get from *knowing* your project/product works
*consistently* means you can have a life instead of constantly worrying
about if something *else* has broken since the last "*patch*".


## 2. Useability

When a site/app does not function as expected (*or worse, it "fails"*)
when people attempt to use it, it frustrates them (* and they often leave for good*).
If you have a way of *automatically testing* (*checking*) everything works as
per the "*user stories*" ensuring a *seamless* "*journey*".

Less Frustration for the People Using your Product!

## 3. Trust

How do you know the code you wrote a week/month/year ago is *still working* as expected?
How can we be sure that a dependency we have included

## 4. Cost (*Saving*)


## 5. Conversion


## 6. Innovation



## 7.
