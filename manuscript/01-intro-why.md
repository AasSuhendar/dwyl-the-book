# Why?[^startwithwhy]

There are *so many* reasons to test your software "*product*" we could write a book just on *why testing is essential*; here are the top 5 reasons:

## 1. Tranquillity

This is the *first* (*reason to test*) because its the *answer* to the question:
"***what's in it for me?***" - people who are *sceptical about testing
inevitably ask*.  

Working in a place without tests is stressful because you never know what is going  to "*break*" next. It can feel like your application is stuck together with *duck tape* and changing one thing will break another. If this sounds like a project you have worked on, get ready for a better life!

The ***peace of mind*** you get from *knowing* your project/product works
*consistently* means you can have a life instead of constantly worrying
about if something *else* has broken since the last "*patch*".

## 2. Trust

If you have ever worked in a company/organisation where people dodge responsibility and are quick to blame others when things go wrong, I feel your pain (*been there, it isn't fun*). There is another (*better*) way. When tests are written *before* the "solution" is implemented, everyone can see *exactly* what the new functionality is *meant* to do.

How do you know the code you wrote a week/month/year ago is *still working* as expected?
How can we be sure that a dependency we have included *always* works as advertised?



## 3. Cost (*Saving*)

The *intial* cost of writing (*automated*) tests may *appear* higher, but *urge* you to think of the investment in writing tests *first* as plotting your destination on a map before you set off.

You *could* just jump straight in/on your vehicle and get going without reading a map (*and hope to get there*) or take the extra few seconds to carefully input the destination into a GPS (*with turn-by-turn directions*)


## X. Repeatability

How many times have you heard this?

## 4. Innovation

Having a reliable codebase means you can innovate faster without fear of breaking existing functionality.



## 5. Happiness

When a site/app does *not* function as expected (*or worse, it "fails"*)
when people attempt to use it, it frustrates them (*and they often leave for good*).
If you have a way of *automatically testing* (*checking*) everything works as per the "*user stories*" ensuring a *seamless* "*journey*" you instantly know if it's usable or not.

Apps which are thoroughly tested tend to have fewer bugs and are thus far more user-friendly; this translates directly into happiness.

Make the people using your product/project happy by testing it *before* giving it to them!
