# Practical Full Stack JavaScript Test Driven Development

A ***practical guide*** to ***Full Stack*** ***T***est ***D***riven ***D***evelopment (TDD) for people building ***robust*** **node.js** and **web / mobile** applications in teams!

## What is "*Full-Stack*" Test Driven Development ?!


### Full-Stack JS?



### Test Driven Development?



## What (*Software*) Testing is *Not*...!

![Software testing is not an exam](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-what-testing-is-not--multiple-choice-with-broken-pencil.jpg "Software Testing is NOT an Exam!")

Some people have a natural aversion to the *idea* of testing because the *word* reminds them having to do exams in *formal education* (*especially those of us who* [***suffered***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6lyURyVz7k) *from the experience!*)

![Don't Panic!](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-dont-panic-unicorn.png "Don't Panic!")


<br />

## No Tests? ... *We Can Fix That*!

There are a number of "*reasons*" (*excuses*!) why people/teams/organisations *still* don't test their work.  
Take your pick from the following:

- "*We don't have time to write tests, we just need to get this done Yesterday!*"
- "*Testing takes too long and means we won't deliver as many features...*"
- "*Its just a small fix, we don't need to write a test*..."
- "*I'm a developer, I don't write tests, we need to hire a tester...*"
- "*If I write a test for every bit of code, then I have to update the tests when I need to change the code, so it's twice as much work...*"

and, last but not least:

- "*That's the way we have always done it here...*"





<br />

## Cowboy Coders?

![Cowboy Coder](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/cowboy-coder.png "Cowboy Coder")

We have all met a *Cowboy Coder* ... The "*I just get things done*"
developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
exclaims: "*I don't have time to write tests*" or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: "*it was working this morning*" ... ***Please share this*** with them and help them see the light!


<br />

## Code Without Test === Building Without Foundation!

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!

![Building Collapse](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/building-collapse-940x627.jpg "Building Collapse")

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

**Q**: *Is* Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software development woes?  
**A**: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But, ***without tests reliability is impossible***.


<br />

## *Say No to Untested Software (Web/Apps)!*

The days of poor quality software are *numbered*; people who continue to expect *inconsistent results* to be rewarded are in for a "*surprise*"!

![They Took Er Jerbs](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/they-took-our-jerbs.jpg "They Took Er Jerbs")


This book is our effort to *accelerate* the process towards ending un-tested software!
We invite *you* to be part of the ***TQM Software*** *movement* and bring all your friends/colleagues!

 <br />


# *Alpha* (Book) Preview

***The Book on Web Application Testing*** is being written one-page-per-day and published at:

> https://leanpub.com/practical-js-tdd

## The Book is Not Ready Yet, Should I Start Reading It?

The answer is: ***it depends***.
If you can handle a few typos and want to get started building better software ASAP, then start *now*! If you prefer to wait till its "ready", please star the repo, register your interest at: https://leanpub.com/practical-js-tdd


## Spreading the Word >> *Please Re-Tweet*!

## Release Schedule

*Each day* for the next 4 months I will be writing *at least* 1 page and pushing it to GitHub (*which triggers the book publish script on LeanPub*) so there will be fresh content *every day*! I promise to make every effort to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as good as possible!

## Contributing [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

We hope this will be a (*highly*) ***collaborative*** effort! (We don't believe in "*lone wolf*" or "*basement genius*" approach to building things... we prefer the many minds/eyes/ideas Open Source culture!)

If you want to contribute you can get started by *reading* the files in the
 /**manuscript** directory. They are ordered numerically by chapter. e.g:
 manuscript/**01-intro-why.md** gives the top 7 reasons why people should be
 testing their work.

### Got Comments/Ideas/Suggestions/Issues ?

If you have any ideas, comments or suggestions, please raise and issue on GitHub: https://github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/issues


### Watching the Repo (*to receive ALL the updates!*)

If you want to receive ***ALL*** the updates, you can **Watch** this GitHub repo. note: you may get quite a few emails... but if you are interested in building great quality software, the content should be relevant to you.

## 100% Open Source

Yes, the book is 100% Open Source on GitHub for anyone to read and contribute to! We (*strongly*) believe that Education should be open and freely available to all!

![education is the most powerful weapon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/Nelson-Mandela-Education-is-the-most-powerful-weapon-you-can-use-to-change-the-world.png)

I was lucky enough to be named after this guy!! (*Thanks Mom!*)



### The Book is Open Source, Why is LeanPub Charging?

Yes, the book is (*and will always be!*) ***100% Open Source***, but LeanPub is kindly providing a way of "packaging" it up for people to read on their devices in the form of a (*DRM-FREE*) **PDF** (*readable on any device*) **Mobi** (*for our friends with kindle*) and **EPUB** (*for iDevices and Macs with iBooks*) they have infrastructure to pay for, so I think its fair to pay a fee for the service they provide ...


## Proceeds of Sale >> *South African Technology School*

***ALL*** the proceeds (*after LeanPub fees*) from the sale of this book will go into the #[**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl/) fund for the ***South African Technology School***
we plan to *build* in **2016** in our quest to create (*well-paid +remote*) Tech Jobs in Africa!

[![BBC Video of School in Africa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/bbc-school-video-screenshot.png)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/zjh4d2p "BBC Video of School in South Africa")

If after watching [*this video*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/zjh4d2p) you aren't inspired to get involved,
please let us know what *does* make you tick and we can donate the proceeds of your copy of the book to a different charity.


## Low on Cash?

![aaand-its-gone-southpark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/aaand-its-gone-southpark.jpg)

If you are a student and/or low for cash (*we've all been there*!) but still want to learn how to build great quality software, please [***personal-message me***](https://twitter.com/nelsonic)
