## Cowboy Coders?

![Cowboy Coder](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/cowboy-coder.png "Cowboy Coder")

We all know *Cowboy Coders*.

The "*I just get things done*" developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
exclaims: "*I don't have time to write tests*" or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: "*it was working this morning*" ...

## Code Without Test === Building Witouht Foundation!

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!

![Building Collapse](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/master/images/building-collapse-940x627.jpg "Building Collapse")

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

**Q**: *Is* Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software development woes?  
**A**: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But *without tests* reliability is *impossible*.

## Embrace *"TQM"* Software and *Say No to Untested*!!

If you are *not* doing TDD in your projects I *might* not be
the one to change your mind by evangelizing about it ... I know
(*and have worked with*) plenty of
people *calling* themesleves "developers" who stubbornly cling to the notion
that *testing is for "QA"* or "*that's why we have testers*" or "*we will write tests later, we just need to release this ASAP!*" etc...  

The days of poor quality software are *numbered*; this book is our effort to *accelerate* the process towards (*Total*) *Quality Code*!

Be part of the ***TQM Software*** *movement* and invite all your friends/colleagues to join in!

## The Book is Not Ready Yet, Should I Start Reading It?

The answer is: ***it depends***.
If you can handle a few typos and want to get started building better software ASAP, then start *now*! If you prefer to wait till its "ready", please star the repo, register your interest at: https://leanpub.com/practical-full-stack-testing


## Spreading the Word >> *Please Re-Tweet*!

## Release Shedule

*Each day* for the next 4 months I will be writing *at least* 1 page and pushing it to GitHub (*which triggers the book publish script on LeanPub*) so there will be fresh content *every day*! I promise to make every effort to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as good as possible!

## Contributing [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

We hope this will be a (*highly*) ***collaborative*** effort! (We don't believe in "*lone wolf*" or "*basement genius*" approach to building things... we prefer the many minds/eyes/ideas Open Source culture!)

If you want to contribute you can get started by *reading* the files in the
 /**manuscript** directory. They are ordered numerically by chapter. e.g:
 manuscript/**01-intro-why.md** gives the top 7 reasons why people should be
 testing their work.

### Got Comments/Ideas/Suggestions/Issues ?

If you have any ideas, comments or suggestions, please raise and issue on GitHub: https://github.com/nelsonic/practical-full-stack-testing/issues


### Watching the Repo (*to receive ALL the updates!*)

If you want to receive ***ALL*** the updates, you can **Watch** this GitHub repo. note: you may get quite a few emails... but if you are interested in building great quality software, the content should be relevant to you.

## The Book is Open Source, Why are you Charging on LeanPub?

Yes, the book is (*and will always be!*) ***100% Open Source***, but LeanPub is kindly providing a way of "packaging" it up for people to read on their devices in the form of a (*DRM-FREE*) **PDF** (*readable on any device*) **Mobi** (*for our friends with kindle*) and **EPUB** (*for iDevices and Macs with iBooks*) they have infrastructure to pay for, so I think its fair to pay a fee for the service they provide ...

## I Can't Afford to Pay for the Book ...

If you are a student and strapped for cash (*we've all been there*!) but still want to learn how to build great quality software, please [*personal-message me***](https://twitter.com/nelsonic) and I will send you the money via PayPal so you can still read the packaged version of the book - and receive all the updates - without any cost!!

## Proceeds of Sale

***ALL*** the proceeds (*after LeanPub fees*) from the sale of this book will go into the #[**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl/) fund for the [***South African Technology School***](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/zjh4d2p) we are planning to *build* in 2016 in our quest to create *well-paid* (*remote*) Tech Jobs in Africa!
