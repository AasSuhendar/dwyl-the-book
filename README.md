_Substitute_ the word "man" for "person" and the "read" for "code"
for the **21st Century** _equivalent_.  
[Coding is the ***new literacy***](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-harbus/coding-is-the-new-busines_b_11028790.html)
and people who don't _make_ the time to _learn/practice_ are _destined for dissapointment_.

# *Why*? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

## _Why_ Should _Anyone_ Learn How to Build Web Apps _Today_?

Think/say what you like about Steve,
he was _right_ about (_at least_) one thing:

![steve jobs learn how to code!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953417/2bb48e3c-da2e-11e6-8ae9-2a46fa6e2a7d.png)

Considering that there are
[_millions_ of "Apps"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/)
_already_, why should I (_or anyone for that matter_) bother
learning how to make _more_ of them?

This is a _great_ question and one we ask _ourselves_
[@dwylhq](https://twitter.com/dwylhq) _often_! <br />
The _answer_ is _another_ question: do you think _all_ the world's
problems/challenges have been _resolved_...? <br />
To which the _answer_ is: ***not even close!***

> Someone _recently_ asked: "_Is software engineering a **dead end** career?_"  
https://www.quora.com/Is-software-engineering-a-dead-end-career

It's `true` (_logical_) that ***eventually*** there _will_ be
["_enough_ apps"](http://valleywag.gawker.com/there-are-officially-too-many-apps-and-nobody-is-makin-1611128750)
to _achieve_ "***all the things***" we need, but "_experts_" have
been [_predicting_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11974922)
the ["_end of software_"]() for the last 20 years.
And yet, the _pace_ of change _continues_ to _accelerate_ and
the number of _jobs_ that aren't being filled because
the "***skills shortage***" has ***increased sharply*** in recent years:

For the _foreseable future_ creating web applications
with the tools/techniques outlined in this book will be a "_thing_".

_Thankfully_, (_or perhaps sadly depending on your view_),
software cannot be _mass produced_ ***yet*** ...

or _embrace_ it...?
A _topic_ for another time ...

so you can _understand_ the AI _debate_!

!["What's In It For Me?"](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21926551/1e282c10-d97a-11e6-96f9-d7074a008f0e.jpg "What's In It For Me?")

### What's "In It" For _Me_?

Our "_podium_" list of what ***you*** will _gain_ by learning this "_content_":

1. The ***vocabulary*** to have **technical discussions** with web developers
(_without sounding like a ["**poser**"](https://youtu.be/nB2ngWWhxEk?t=3m49s)
which is **not** the same as a ["**beginner**"](https://youtu.be/kKO3dXiTl1s) ..._)
even if you decide not be a full-time coder, if you know _how_ to code,
you will have a _far_ more fruitful time working with technical people.
2. A chance to Meet & collaborate with ***interesting people*** on using
technology to make the world a better place for everyone!
3. (_last but not least_) The "***skills*** _to pay the bills_"
which will let you build your _own_ ideas
or get paid (_really well_) to work on a challenge with an _existing_ team.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21952954/abe46f48-da22-11e6-97c2-4864316ceb56.png)

As with _any_ skill, your coding skills are  whatever you `make` of them!


## _Why_ Write a "_Book_"?

The `main` reason we decided to organize our knowledge/experience as a "_book_"
is because people were _using_ (_and loving_) our tutorials _individually_

[![people-find-dwyl-tutorials-useful](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953434/b44b311a-da2e-11e6-9675-e4af89bb8eaa.png)](https://twitter.com/dwylhq/status/775016209263845377)

but people _kept asking_ us:

> **Question**: "_Is there an **order** in which I
should follow your tutorials_...?" <br />
> **Answer**: ***Yes***!

The reason(s) we did not _state_ the order of learning `before` were:
+ the _sheer number_ of "_things_" to learn would have overwhelmed _us_.
+ there were _so many_ "_gaps_" in our documentation that we would
have suffered from a _panic-induced "**blank page syndrome**" writers-block_
and never got _started_!

We are _very_ conscious of the fact that there is a "_lot to learn_"
in order to build web applications.

By making individual self-contained tutorials we were able to "_chunk_"
the knowledge into parts that were relevant to people searching for
a guid specific to that subject.

present our _series_ of tutorials in a _reasonably_ systematic/linear
format that anyone can follow in an _order_.

The _second_ reason is to make it "_portable_". By grouping all of our
tutorials in a single PDF people can put it on their e-Reader and
read it "**AFK**" or even pipe it through a "screen reader"
and listen as an _Audio Book_!

> The _reason_ we wrote the _individual_ tutorials was out of _frustration_/_pain_
of working in organisations where knowledge was not distributed.
Count yourself _lucky_ if you have never worked at a company
where people "_hoard_" and "_guard_" their knowledge/skill/data/insight because
they think it will maintain their "_power_", "_position_" or "_infulence_".
We @dwylhq have worked in _many_ such companies and grew weary of
the "_boss_" who kept "_secrets_" or the "_subject matter expert_"
that could not be fired even though they were killing team morale.
***Systematically sharing our knowledge*** is our way of avoiding that charade!


# *Who*?

## ~~Readers~~ Learners

Who _should_ read (_and practice_) this...?

If you are (_already_) learning (_or want to learn how_)
to build Web-based Applications (_that "**Work Everywhere**"_)
using Open Source ***Free*** tools this book
(_or it's individual self-contained/standalone "chapters"_)
will be *relevant* to you. Our _aim_ is that the content is _useful_
to ***everyone writing code*** _at_ ***any level***, however we are
starting with a focus on "_complete beginner_" and will work our way
up to "_advanced_" and will answer _any_ question you have along the journey!

If _anyone_ tells you that learning to code is a bad idea,
just smile and think to yourself:

> "***Never mind what haters say,
ignore them till they fade away***"
~ [T.I. (Live Your Life)](https://youtu.be/koVHN6eO4Xg)


## Writers

Unlike _most_ other books written by *one* person or even handful of people,
and "_published_" (_printed_) in paper
`this` book has _**many contributors**_ and is _constinuously_ evolving.

> “***Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much***” ~ Helen Keller

As such it is the
[***Wisdom of the crowd***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd).
So if you spot an issue/typo in the text/code or have a better idea
(_e.g. a simpler explanation for a topic/concept_)
_**please** post_ an [issue](https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues) (_thanks!_)


# *What*?

This book is a _collection_ of ***practical usage examples for tools
we use to build web apps***.  
We ***wish*** we had `this` content `before` we _started_ coding,
_instead_ we had to learn things the _hard(er)_ way
_making **lots** of "**mistakes**"..._

![never-made-any-mistatkes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/21953354/68d60342-da2c-11e6-8723-f1915ab90357.png)

We have learned from our mistakes and _documented_ most of them!
Hopefully it's ***useful*** to other people.

### What can we _Make_ with the Knowledge/Skills in the Book?

The knowledge/skills you will gain from learning/practicing
the content will allow you to build web-based applications (_that "**Work Everywhere**"_)
for *many* reasons including (to):

+ ***Connect & communicate*** with our friends, colleagues & communities
+ ***Record & share*** information, knowledge, news, events, etc.
+ **Manage** all aspects of our lives (calendars, task/time trackers,
  shopping/wish lists, etc.)
+ **Run** organisations/businesses (_Administration, Workflow & "Management" Apps_)
+ **Buy/sell** things (_E-Commerce_)
+ ***Have fun***! (_e.g. online games! augmented/virtual reality!_)

Most universities/schools (_still_) don't teach practical web skills
as the *foundation* for computer science / software engineering ...
there are a number of _reasons_ for this, but the primary reason is that
the learning institution's curriculum is calcified by inertia...

The result of people not learning "modern" web technologies at "school" is
the _majority_ of companies/organisations *still* lack skills so most apps suck!
We are "_fixing_" the "_problem_".

<!--
If you are _still_ not writing tests _**why not**_?
We _urge_ you to _read_ the *first* chapter ("_A Brief Introduction to TDD_") and decide for yourself if you _still_ think its "_too difficult_" or "_takes longer_".
-->

### "_Free_" and Open Source...?

Yes, the book is **100% _Free_ and _Open Source_**  on GitHub for anyone to
read and contribute to! We (*strongly*) believe that Education should be
open and freely available to all (*not controlled or monopolized for profit*)!

![education is the most powerful weapon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-Nelson-Mandela-Education-is-the-most-powerful-weapon-you-can-use-to-change-the-world.png)

Obviously, putting together learning resources takes time
and most people don't have a lot of "_free time_"...
But we prefer to think of our knowledge sharing as an _investment_
in our people/_team(s)_ that pays _handsomly_ and _almost immediately_
because it _systematically_ "_transfers knowledge_" which both
improves the _pace_ of our work and reduces "_risk_" for our customers!
Win-win-win-win!!

## What "*Stack*" do you cover?

A "stack" is the term use to describe all the components involved in a web app.
The more comprehensive definition is:

>"In computing, a solution stack is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications. Applications are said to "run on" or "run on top of" the resulting platform.

> ... in a web application the architect defines the stack as the target operating system, web server, database, and programming language."

A Typical Stack would include:

+ Linux/Unix as the ***Server*** Operating System (OS)
+ a ***web application framework*** running on the server. Example frameworks include:
  + Ruby-on-Rails/Sinatra (Ruby),
  + Django (Python),
  + CodeIgniter/Symphony/Drupal (PHP),
  + akka (Scala/Java),
  + Express.js/Meteor.js/[_**Hapi.js**_](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi)
  (JavaScript/Node.js), etc.
+ the (web app) framework connects to a ***database***.
There are many databases (often referred to as "*data stores*"),
the most popular are:
  + SQL-Based: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
  + NoSQL: MongoDB, CouchDB,
  [_**RethinkDB**_](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-rethinkdb/), HBase, etc
  + Search: [_**ElasticSearch**_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elasticsearch)
  + Key Value Store: [_**Redis**_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-redis), LevelDB
+ Browser-based interactivity (*often referred to as the* "***Client***"
*or* "***Front End***" *of the stack*).

The "Stack" we use is _evolving_ with the latest industry _innovation_.
Please see: https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/
and if you want to `#GetInvolved` in the dicussion,
read and comment on the issues: https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues

## "*Full-Stack*" JavaScript?

The term "*Full Stack*" Developer has been around for a while.
We like [@laurencegellert](https://twitter.com/laurencegellert)'s
explanation:

> "*a Full Stack Developer is someone with* ***familiarity in each layer***, ***if not mastery in many*** *and a* ***genuine interest in all software technology***."

We agree with [@peteryared](https://twitter.com/peteryared) that it's naive to expect *anyone* to be an "*expert*" in *every* aspect of our stack,
but we do think that by using ***JavaScript*** as the programming language for the server (Node.js), client (*take your pick of framework!*) and datastore
(*any of the NoSQL datastores which store JSON documents*), it's easier to go "full stack".

See: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/

### "*Front End*"?

In web development, there is ***one language*** that *all* web browsers understand: ***JavaScript***
As a result it is the _most popular programming language_:


The web browser or mobile device (displaying content in a "*web view*")
is referred to as the "*Front End*"


### "Back End"?

When people refer to the "Back End" of an app they are describing the
"*Server*" component(s).

There are *many* technologies/languages/frameworks you can use to write
your server. As stated above, for *simplicity* we prefer to use JavaScript (*Node.js*) on the server to keep one programming language across the stack and allow us to re-use view code for both server-side and client-side rendering.


## Test Driven Development?

Writing tests for all aspects of your application.



## What (*Software*) Testing is *Not*...!

![Software testing is not an exam](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-what-testing-is-not--multiple-choice-with-broken-pencil.jpg "Software Testing is NOT an Exam!")

Some people have a natural aversion to the *idea* of testing because the *word* reminds them having to do exams in *formal education* (*especially those of us who* [***suffered***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6lyURyVz7k) *from the experience!*)

![Don't Panic!](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-dont-panic-unicorn.png "Don't Panic!")

***Don't Panic***! Writing tests for your Web Application is on the opposite end of the *Fun* Spectrum from multiple choice tests we all know (*and hate*!)

<br />

## No Tests? ... *We Can Fix That*!

There are a number of "*reasons*" (*excuses*!) why people/teams/organisations *still* don't test their work.  
Take your pick from the following:

- "*We don't have time to write tests, we just need to get this done Yesterday!*"
- "*Testing takes too long and means we won't deliver as many features...*"
- "*Its just a small fix, we don't need to write a test*..."
- "*I'm a developer, I don't write tests, we need to hire a tester...*"
- "*If I write a test for every bit of code, then I have to update the tests when I need to change the code, so it's twice as much work...*"

and, last but not least:

- "*That's the way we have always done it here...*"

As a comparison, [***this***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8110) is how we ***used*** to do Mobile Phones ... How many people do you still see carrying "*The Matrix Phone*" (*which was all-the-rage in the* ***90's***!) *today*?

![Matrix Phone Nokia 8110](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-matrixphone.jpg "Matrix Phone Nokia 8110")

![Steve Jobs introducing iPhone in 2007](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-steve-jobs-introduces-iphone.jpg "Steve Jobs introducing iPhone in 2007")


We have better phones; shouldn't we also have better software development methods?

<br />

## Cowboy Coders?

![Cowboy Coder](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-cowboy-coder.png "Cowboy Coder")

We have all met a *Cowboy Coder* ... The "*I just get things done*"
developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
exclaims: "*I don't have time to write tests*" or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: "*it was working this morning*" ... ***Please share this*** with them and help them see the light!


<br />

## Code Without Test === Building Without Foundation!

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!

![Building Collapse](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-building-collapse-940x627.jpg "Building Collapse")

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

**Q**: *Is* Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software development woes?  
**A**: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But, ***without tests reliability is impossible***.


<br />

## *Say No to Untested Software (Web/Apps)!*

The days of poor quality software are *numbered*; people who continue to expect *inconsistent results* to be rewarded are in for a "*surprise*"!

![They Took Er Jerbs](https://raw.github.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-they-took-our-jerbs.jpg "They Took Er Jerbs")


This book is our effort to *accelerate* the process towards ending un-tested software!
We invite *you* to be part of the ***TQM Software*** *movement* and bring all your friends/colleagues!

 <br />


## The Book is Not "Finished" Yet, Should I Start Reading It?

The answer is: ***it depends***.
If you can handle a few typos and want to get started building better Apps ASAP,
then start *now*! If you prefer to wait till its "ready", please star the repo,
and come back later.


## Spreading the Word >> *Please Re-Tweet*!

## Release Schedule

*Each day* for the next 4 months I will be writing *at least* 1 page and pushing it to GitHub (*which triggers the book publish script on LeanPub*) so there will be fresh content *every day*! I promise to make every effort to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as good as possible!

## Contributing [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

We hope this will be a (*highly*) ***collaborative*** effort!
(We don't believe in "*lone wolf*" or "*basement genius*" approach
to building things... we prefer the many minds/eyes/ideas Open Source culture!)

if you **do not care who gets** the **credit**_" ~ Harry Truman

## Star the Project :star:

The _easiest_ way you can _contribute_ is
by "_starring_" this project on GitHub!
This will help you to "_bookmark_" the content so you can return to it.
But it will also help the people who "_follow_" you on GitHub to _discover_
that you find it _interesting_ or _useful_.
The _more_ people star and _share_

### Got Comments/Ideas/Suggestions/Issues ?

If you have any ideas, comments or suggestions,
please raise an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues


### Watching the Repo (*to receive ALL the updates!*)

If you want to receive ***ALL*** the updates, you can **Watch** this GitHub repo. note: you may get quite a few emails... but if you are interested in building great quality software, the content should be relevant to you.


<!--

### The Book is Open Source, Why is LeanPub Charging?

Yes, the book is (*and will always be!*) ***100% Open Source***, but LeanPub is kindly providing a way of "packaging" it up for people to read on their devices in the form of a (*[DRM-FREE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Opposition_to_DRM)*) **PDF** (*readable on any device*) **Mobi** (*for our friends with kindle*) and **EPUB** (*for iDevices and Macs with iBooks*) they have infrastructure to pay for, so I think its fair to pay a fee for the service they provide ...

Don't worry, its not "freemium" ...

![freemium is not free](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/the-book/master/manuscript/images/00-freemium-not-really.jpg)

We are posting every word open on github, so if you don't *want or need* the Kindle or iBooks version, just read it online for *free*.

## History (*[tl;dr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TL;DR)*)

[_**I**_](https://github.com/nelsonic) started writing tutorials
on Test Driven Development (TDD) out of ***frustration***
when (_some individuals in_) my *then* team *complained*
that "_testing is 'hard' and takes too long..._".
It seemed *logical* to publish the tutorials as step-by-step guides on GitHub
(_as opposed to a company wiki or Google Docs which I had done before..._)
so that others could benefit from the learning
and submit ideas for improvement or requests for more detail via
[questions (issues)](https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues),
_updates_ or _corrections_ (_e.g. updating a link or fixing a typo!_)
in the form of GitHub Pull Requests.

A few (*hundred*) GitHub stars (_and encouraging feedback messages_) later,
we created a GitHub _Community_ (_Organisation_) dedicated to curating coding
tutorials: https://github.com/dwyl (_which now has **many active members**_)
and _collaboratively building useful tools using code_
which _any_ organisation/school/buisness can use ***free of charge***!

All coding examples for this book are released as self-contained/standalone
tutorials so you can *selectively learn* a *specific* tool/technique/technology
and share *just* that one _byte_ of learning with your team
(_or that one **special person** in your life who you know has
  **infinite potential** but keeps making excuses to not get with the program!_)
