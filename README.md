## _Why_ Should _Anyone_ Learn How to Build Web Apps _Today_?

Considering that there are
[_millions_ of "Apps"](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/)
_already_, why should I (_or anyone for that matter_) bother
learning how to make _more_ of them?

This is a _great_ question and one we ask _ourselves_
[@dwylhq](https://twitter.com/dwylhq) _often_! <br />
The _answer_ is _another_ question: do you think _all_ the world's
problems/challenges have been _resolved_...? <br />
To which the _answer_ is: ***not even close!***

> Someone _recently_ asked: "_Is software engineering a **dead end** career?_"  
https://www.quora.com/Is-software-engineering-a-dead-end-career

It's `true` (_logical_) that ***eventually*** there _will_ be "_enough_" apps
to _achieve_ "***all the things***" we need, but "_experts_" have
been [_predicting_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11974922)
the ["_end of software_"]() for the last 20 years.
And yet, the _pace_ of change _continues_ to _accelerate_.

> "***Software is eating the world***" ~ Marc Andreessen <br />
http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460  
**Tip**: _disable_ JS in your browser to _read_ the article without
Rupert forcing you to _pay_ for knowledge! <br />
**Five Years Later**:
https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/software-is-eating-the-world-5-years-later/

For the _foreseable future_ creating web applications
with the tools/techniques outlined in this book will be a "_thing_".

> "***You can mass-produce hardware; you cannot mass-produce software -
  you cannot mass-produce the human mind***"" ~ Michio Kaku

_Thankfully_, (_or perhaps sadly depending on your view_),
software cannot be _mass produced_ ***yet*** ...
Should you/we be "_afraid_" of [**AI**](https://youtu.be/05bGPiyM4jg)
or _embrace_ it...?
A _topic_ for another time ...
for _now_, focus leveling-up your skills,
so you can _understand_ the AI _debate_!

### What's "In It" For _Me_?

Our "_podium_" list of what ***you*** will _gain_ by learning this "_content_":

1. The ***vocabulary*** to have **technical discussions** with web developers
(_without sounding like a ["**poser**"](https://youtu.be/nB2ngWWhxEk?t=3m49s)
which is **not** the same as a ["**beginner**"](https://youtu.be/kKO3dXiTl1s) ..._)
even if you decide not be a full-time coder, if you know _how_ to code,
you will have a _far_ more fruitful time working with technical people.
2. The "***skills*** _to pay the bills_" which will let you build your _own_
ideas get paid (_really well_) to work on a challenge with an _existing_ team.
3. Meet & collaborate with ***interesting people*** on ideas that make
the world a better place.

## _Why_ Write a "_Book_"?

The `main` reason we decided to organize our knowledge/experience as a "_book_"
is to present the _series_ of tutorials in a _reasonably_ systematic/linear
format that people can follow in an _order_.

The _second_ reason is to make it "_portable_". By grouping all of our
tutorials in a single PDF people can put it on their e-Reader and
read it "**AFK**" or even pipe it through a "screen reader" as an Audio Book!

This book is a _collection_ of ***practical usage examples for tools
we use to build web apps***.  
We ***wish*** we had this when we _started_ coding, hopefully it's
***useful*** to other people!

# *Who*?

## Readers

Who _should_ read this...?

If you are (_already_) learning (_or want to learn how_) to build Web-based Apps
(_that "**Work Everywhere**"_) using Open Source tools this book
(_or it's individual self-contained/standalone "chapters"_)
will be *relevant* to you. Our _aim_ is that the content is useful
to ***everyone writing code*** _at_ ***any level***, however we are
starting with "_complete beginner_" and will work our way up to "_advanced_"
and will answer _any_ question you have along the way!


## Writers

Unlike _most_ other books written by *one* person or even handful of people,
`this` book has _**many contributors**_ and is _constantly_ evolving.
As such it is the
[***Wisdom of the crowd***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd).
If you spot an issue/typo in the text/code or have a better idea (e.g. a simpler explanation for a topic/concept) _please post_ an [issue](https://github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/issues) (_thanks!_)


# *What*?

We build web-based applications (_that "**Work Everywhere**"_)
for *many* reasons including (to):

+ ***Connect & communicate*** with our friends, colleagues & communities
+ ***Record & share*** information, knowledge, news, events, etc.
+ **Manage** all aspects of our lives (calendars, task/time trackers,
  shopping/wish lists, etc.)
+ **Run** organisations/businesses (_Administration, Workflow & "Management" Apps_)
+ **Buy/sell** things (_E-Commerce_)
+ ***Have fun***! (_e.g. online games! augmented/virtual reality!_)

Most universities/schools (_still_) don't teach testing as the *foundation* for computer science / software engineering ... there are a number of _reasons_ for this, but the primary reason is the fact that learning institution curriculum is calcified.

The result of people not learning testing at school is the _majority_ of companies/organisations *still* lack tests and the (_untested_) cycle perpetuates ...

If you are _still_ not writing tests _**why not**_?
We _urge_ you to _read_ the *first* chapter ("_A Brief Introduction to TDD_") and decide for yourself if you _still_ think its "_too difficult_" or "_takes longer_".

## "*Stack*"?

A "stack" is the term use to describe all the components involved in a web app. The more comprehensive definition is:

>"In computing, a solution stack is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications. Applications are said to "run on" or "run on top of" the resulting platform.

> ... in a web application the architect defines the stack as the target operating system, web server, database, and programming language."

A Typical Stack would include:

+ Linux/Unix as the ***Server*** Operating System (OS)
+ a ***web application framework*** running on the server. Example frameworks include:
  + Ruby-on-Rails/Sinatra (Ruby),
  + Django (Python),
  + CodeIgniter/Symphony/Drupal (PHP),
  + akka (Scala/Java),
  + Express.js/Meteor.js/[_**Hapi.js**_](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi) (JavaScript/Node.js), etc.
+ the (web app) framework connects to a ***database***. There are many databases (often referred to as "*data stores*"), the most popular are:
  + SQL-Based: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
  + NoSQL: MongoDB, CouchDB, [_**RethinkDB**_](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-rethinkdb/), HBase, etc
  + Search: [_**ElasticSearch**_](https://github.com/docdis/learn-elasticsearch)
  + Key Value Store: [_**Redis**_](https://github.com/docdis/learn-redis), LevelDB
+ Browser-based interactivity (*often referred to as the* "***Client***" *or* "***Front End***" *of the stack*).

## "*Full-Stack*" JavaScript?

The term "*Full Stack*" Developer has been around for a while.
We like [@laurencegellert](https://twitter.com/laurencegellert)'s
explanation:

> "*a Full Stack Developer is someone with* ***familiarity in each layer***, ***if not mastery in many*** *and a* ***genuine interest in all software technology***."

We agree with [@peteryared](https://twitter.com/peteryared) that it's naive to expect *anyone* to be an "*expert*" in *every* aspect of our stack,
but we do think that by using ***JavaScript*** as the programming language for the server (Node.js), client (*take your pick of framework!*) and datastore
(*any of the NoSQL datastores which store JSON documents*), it's easier to go "full stack".

See: http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-full-stack-developer/

### "*Front End*"?

In web development, there is ***one language*** that *all* web browsers understand: ***JavaScript***

The web browser or mobile device (displaying content in a "*web view*")
is referred to as the "*Front End*"


###Â "Back End"?

When people refer to the "Back End" of an app they are describing the
"*Server*" component(s).

There are *many* technologies/languages/frameworks you can use to write
your server. As stated above, for *simplicity* we prefer to use JavaScript (*Node.js*) on the server to keep one programming language across the stack and allow us to re-use view code for both server-side and client-side rendering.


## Test Driven Development?

Writing tests for all aspects of your application.



## What (*Software*) Testing is *Not*...!

![Software testing is not an exam](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-what-testing-is-not--multiple-choice-with-broken-pencil.jpg "Software Testing is NOT an Exam!")

Some people have a natural aversion to the *idea* of testing because the *word* reminds them having to do exams in *formal education* (*especially those of us who* [***suffered***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6lyURyVz7k) *from the experience!*)

![Don't Panic!](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-dont-panic-unicorn.png "Don't Panic!")

***Don't Panic***! Writing tests for your Web Application is on the opposite end of the *Fun* Spectrum from multiple choice tests we all know (*and hate*!)

<br />

## No Tests? ... *We Can Fix That*!

There are a number of "*reasons*" (*excuses*!) why people/teams/organisations *still* don't test their work.  
Take your pick from the following:

- "*We don't have time to write tests, we just need to get this done Yesterday!*"
- "*Testing takes too long and means we won't deliver as many features...*"
- "*Its just a small fix, we don't need to write a test*..."
- "*I'm a developer, I don't write tests, we need to hire a tester...*"
- "*If I write a test for every bit of code, then I have to update the tests when I need to change the code, so it's twice as much work...*"

and, last but not least:

- "*That's the way we have always done it here...*"

As a comparison, [***this***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8110) is how we ***used*** to do Mobile Phones ... How many people do you still see carrying "*The Matrix Phone*" (*which was all-the-rage in the* ***90's***!) *today*?

![Matrix Phone Nokia 8110](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-matrixphone.jpg "Matrix Phone Nokia 8110")

![Steve Jobs introducing iPhone in 2007](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-steve-jobs-introduces-iphone.jpg "Steve Jobs introducing iPhone in 2007")


We have better phones; shouldn't we also have better software development methods?

<br />

## Cowboy Coders?

![Cowboy Coder](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-cowboy-coder.png "Cowboy Coder")

We have all met a *Cowboy Coder* ... The "*I just get things done*"
developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
exclaims: "*I don't have time to write tests*" or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: "*it was working this morning*" ... ***Please share this*** with them and help them see the light!


<br />

## Code Without Test === Building Without Foundation!

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!

![Building Collapse](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-building-collapse-940x627.jpg "Building Collapse")

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

**Q**: *Is* Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software development woes?  
**A**: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But, ***without tests reliability is impossible***.


<br />

## *Say No to Untested Software (Web/Apps)!*

The days of poor quality software are *numbered*; people who continue to expect *inconsistent results* to be rewarded are in for a "*surprise*"!

![They Took Er Jerbs](https://raw.github.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-they-took-our-jerbs.jpg "They Took Er Jerbs")


This book is our effort to *accelerate* the process towards ending un-tested software!
We invite *you* to be part of the ***TQM Software*** *movement* and bring all your friends/colleagues!

 <br />


## The Book is Not "Finished" Yet, Should I Start Reading It?

The answer is: ***it depends***.
If you can handle a few typos and want to get started building better Apps ASAP,
then start *now*! If you prefer to wait till its "ready", please star the repo,
and come back later.


## Spreading the Word >> *Please Re-Tweet*!

## Release Schedule

*Each day* for the next 4 months I will be writing *at least* 1 page and pushing it to GitHub (*which triggers the book publish script on LeanPub*) so there will be fresh content *every day*! I promise to make every effort to keep the signal-to-noise ratio as good as possible!

## Contributing [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

We hope this will be a (*highly*) ***collaborative*** effort!
(We don't believe in "*lone wolf*" or "*basement genius*" approach
to building things... we prefer the many minds/eyes/ideas Open Source culture!)

> "_It is **amazing** what you can **accomplish**
if you **do not care who gets** the **credit**_" ~ Harry Truman

## Star the Project :star:

The _easiest_ way you can _contribute_ is
by "_starring_" this project on GitHub!
This will help you to "_bookmark_" the content so you can return to it.
But it will also help the people who "_follow_" you on GitHub to _discover_
that you find it _interesting_ or _useful_.
The _more_ people star and _share_

### Got Comments/Ideas/Suggestions/Issues ?

If you have any ideas, comments or suggestions,
please raise an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues


### Watching the Repo (*to receive ALL the updates!*)

If you want to receive ***ALL*** the updates, you can **Watch** this GitHub repo. note: you may get quite a few emails... but if you are interested in building great quality software, the content should be relevant to you.

## 100% Open Source

Yes, the book is 100% Open Source on GitHub for anyone to read and contribute to! We (*strongly*) believe that Education should be open and freely available to all (*not controlled or monopolised for profit*)!

![education is the most powerful weapon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-Nelson-Mandela-Education-is-the-most-powerful-weapon-you-can-use-to-change-the-world.png)

<!--

### The Book is Open Source, Why is LeanPub Charging?

Yes, the book is (*and will always be!*) ***100% Open Source***, but LeanPub is kindly providing a way of "packaging" it up for people to read on their devices in the form of a (*[DRM-FREE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Opposition_to_DRM)*) **PDF** (*readable on any device*) **Mobi** (*for our friends with kindle*) and **EPUB** (*for iDevices and Macs with iBooks*) they have infrastructure to pay for, so I think its fair to pay a fee for the service they provide ...

Don't worry, its not "freemium" ...

![freemium is not free](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/practical-js-tdd/master/manuscript/images/00-freemium-not-really.jpg)

We are posting every word open on github, so if you don't *want or need* the Kindle or iBooks version, just read it online for *free*.

## Proceeds of Sale >> *South African Technology School*

***ALL*** the proceeds (*after LeanPub fees*) from the sale of this book will go into the #[**dwyl**](https://github.com/dwyl/) fund for the ***South African Technology School***
we plan to *build* in **2016** in our quest to create (*well-paid +remote*) Tech Jobs in Africa!

## History (*[tl;dr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TL;DR)*)

[_**I**_](https://github.com/nelsonic) started writing tutorials
on Test Driven Development (TDD) out of ***frustration***
when (_some individuals in_) my *then* team *complained*
that "_testing is 'hard' and takes too long..._".
It seemed *logical* to publish the tutorials as step-by-step guides on GitHub
(_as opposed to a company wiki or Google Docs which I had done before..._)
so that others could benefit from the learning
and submit ideas for improvement or requests for more detail via
[questions (issues)](https://github.com/dwyl/the-book/issues),
_updates_ or _corrections_ (_e.g. updating a link or fixing a typo!_)
in the form of GitHub Pull Requests.

A few (*hundred*) GitHub stars (_and encouraging feedback messages_) later,
we created a GitHub _Community_ (_Organisation_) dedicated to curating coding
tutorials: https://github.com/dwyl (_which now has **many active members**_)
and _collaboratively building useful tools using code_
which _any_ organisation/school/buisness can use ***free of charge***!

All coding examples for this book are released as self-contained/standalone
tutorials so you can *selectively learn* a *specific* tool/technique/technology
and share *just* that one _byte_ of learning with your team
(_or that one **special person** in your life who you know has
  **infinite potential** but keeps making excuses to not get with the program!_)
