We all know *Cowboy Coders*.

The "*I just get things done*" developer who writes "*quick fixes*" and
maintains "*I don't have time to write tests*" or
"*Writing tests for my code takes longer*" and then acts *surprised* when
everything starts breaking while claiming: "*it was working this morning*" ...

Code without tests is like a *building without a foundation*!

Its only a matter of *time* before it all comes crashing down ...

**Q**: *Is* Test Driven Development (TDD) a *silver bullet* for *all* my software development woes?  
**A**: **No**.
There is a *lot* more that goes into writing *great* software than
*just* having tests. But *without tests* reliability is *impossible*.

If you are *not* doing TDD in your projects I'm probably not going to be
the one to change your mind by evangelizing about it. I know plenty of
people calling themesleves "developers" who stubbornly cling to the idea
that testing is for "QA" or "That's why we have testers" and wish them
nothing but the best of luck! I just cant't work with you or use your
"product", no hard feelings. :-)
